### What is RX-Java
RxJava, a popular open-source implementation of the ReactiveX library that brings reactive programming to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). RxJava is designed to take the pain out of working with asynchronous streams of data.

RxJava is a library that lets you create applications in the reactive programming style. At its core, reactive programming provides a clean, efficient way of processing and reacting to streams of real-time data, including data with dynamic values.

RxJava pretty much treats everything as a stream of data—everything from variables to properties, caches, and even user input events like clicks and swipes.

The data emitted by each stream can either be a value, an error, or a "completed" signal, although you don’t necessarily have to implement the last two
